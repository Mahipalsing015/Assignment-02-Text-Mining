Samsung s10 is much better than iphone 11
"hi I had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon. But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to servers Finding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work fine but it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to work today while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not working I have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain"
I found this black spot while doing set up. Given me defective piece & now not able to give for replacement also. It's a very next day of purchase.
"Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible."
"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys!!"
Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
"The worst phn I have bought,started to heat up badly the very first time I switched it on ,Moreover it heats up everytime when I switch it on.Tried returning it to apple they denied,don't buy it from amazon"
"Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen. After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11. Horrible experience with #Amazon. ?? Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone. Further I don't have idea for battery, face recognition and camera as I was not able to use iphone 11 and till now I have only bitter experience."
"Pathetic Amazon service!! Don't buy online. My back camera has problem, shows many green dots. Apple store is of little help. Amazon as expected, is of NO help. Waiting to get this resolved. I preferred this over pixel just for camera!!! Sigh!!!"
"After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that it’s totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, it’s been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only! If you’re looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it! There are a few bugs however, but they’re iOS bugs which’ll be sorted soon I’m sure with upcoming updates!"
"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone: Pros: A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated] The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020] Somewhere between great to excellent battery life The software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC The phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel. Cons: Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact. You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text. The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone. And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process. Conclusion with personal thoughts: Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
I want to return the product because it looks like a refurbished one however no one is contacting with me not taking order. Please do no buy it because its not a new product and also you can not return it
"I Ordered on 24 January 2020 already i am having three issues in that bluetooth is not working, Phone is getting hanged and battery back up is to low the product is defect it's just 6 Days i have purchased it's so bad experience which i never thaught off ."
"I am having Mike n speaker issue, n due to lockdown I dint got chance to return it, but I dint expected this Frm amazon surely not with product like APPLE"
The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .
"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost. The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ?, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones. Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point. Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79? for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop. The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition. One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings. Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags. I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware."
"NEVER GO FOR AMAZON IF IT'S I PHONE.... Had some issues with lock screen... When informed and asked for replacement, Amazon agents said me to visit a I store... There is more chance of getting a refurbished phone in the name of new phone... Be careful... Don't buy goods of this worth from online sites..."
"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need."
"My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone ?? Better Go for shop To buy apple products ."
This is phone is amazing! Face ID : responsive and super save!! Camera: It’s the best feature of this phone! Really good camera. Display: it’s still good! When compared to a one plus 7 and 8. It’s just brighter but it’s not sharper If you want the best display in the game go for 11 pro. I have no complaints on this
"Display is not at par. even after adjusting the colour settings. More of Yellow tint. Screen width is not suitable for e- reading in phone. Top notch is disturbance for watching videos in full screen. Keyboard is occupying half of the phone space. Camera, I think my expectations are on higher side. Side button disconnects the call and doesn’t lock the screen during the calls. However phone performance and sound are good. In my opinion I should have waited for iPhone 12."
"Received faulty phone. Don't buy here, buy from store. I am suffering from a problem with this phone but Amazon is directing me to the iPhone store now rather than return or replacement, so what's the point in purchasing from amazon."
"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging."
The media could not be loaded. I received the phone on 19 sep 2021 and I purchased my adapter separately and received on 21 sep. There was no charge in phone so when I put on charge it stuck in apple logo and keep rebooting. Called to Amazon and they don’t take ownership since it’s apple responsibility which is eventually 300 km far . Just I could not understand if we receive damage product or wrong manufactured then it’s customer who has to struggle. Very bad experience. Please stay away from buying phone specially iPhone from Amazon
"got the phone delivered within a day . Excellent service. But I guess the responsibility ends there itself. the product is faulty . Screen flickers , touch screen becomes un-responsive, screen black out for a few seconds is common and above all the iphone heats up horribly to an extent that it made me uncomfortable holding the phone. having read on google now, it seems the product is faulty and heating is a common problem. Fed up of liaising with Apple & Amazon . hoping it will be replaced"
Provided with defective product . Struggling for replacement since then . There are so many hidden terms and conditions. It's my last order on Amazon
"Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly. i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after."
the product is good and working up to expectations....sorry for miss understanding the issue and I was under the impression that the product was defective...as I wasn’t hearing the voice of other person speaking....this happened because of thin flap of covering on screen
"I have received brand new mobile on 03-10-2021. You can on screen shot, used product received. Validity- 12-08-2021. Don’t buy"
There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it’s only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ? Although since it’s Amazon fulfilled I was care free that there would no Damage only after 2 days I was able to notice the damage although everything else looks fine . It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it . If not then I think I would not be buying any electronics product from Amazon it better to buy from store co I can check everything on the spot .
Awesome phone great camera quality .
"The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn’t respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated.... After one month..... Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly."
Freaking pathetic when the phone was a defective piece and wanted to replace/refund.. they say contact the apple brand and when I go to them they say they don't have any connection since it was bought from Amazon and when I contacted the Amazon someone names ( TANMAYA) was in touch as customer service agent was trying to toss me around here and there ...and when I ask for a denial letter that Amazon and they claim they aren't responsible for this..
"Worst ever! Battery health starts to drop within 3 months of usage. Camera for pictures suck when compared to OnePlus or other android phones. Phone gets heated up within 10-15 minutes of talking over calls or internet use. Apple customer care doesn’t do anything but say this is best IPhone ever and everything is good with it. Also, I bought on EMI for 6 months with HDFC credit card with a 5000rs discount but i have to pay the EMI for the full amount gets cut every month."
"Do not ,I repeat do not buy iPhone from this retailer. My phone stopped turning on after 2 weeks of purchase . After giving it to the service center it had to be sent to Bangalore where it was replaced and sent back to me again. But I was without my phone for almost a month. My phone is working fine now but all in all it was such a hassle. Never buy an apple product from this retailer called appario retail pvt ltd.Best to buy it from the store."
"Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return fast Very very bad experience"
worst phone and worst service..I bought from amazon and new phone had excessive heating issue..tried contacting amazon but no help was given..wasted my money n then had to run after apple people for new phome defect and its been 2 weeks i dont hav my phone..dont buy atleasr from amazon
"After analyzing for many months, finally took the decision to buy my first IPhone from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon, seller & delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised & in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage - Pros 1. Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user. 2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps. 3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced. 4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen. 5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone. Cons 1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided. 2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors. Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons. I do not miss the 120Hz refresh or amoled screen while using the phone."
I received iPhone 11 yesterday and just after doing the initial setup as soon as I used the phone the touch screen stopped working and I was unable to swipe up and use the phone at all. I raised a exchange request immediately. But Amazon completely denied to exchange the phone even after it has 7 day replacement and suggested me to visit apple Care center for resolution. The product is not even repaired by Apple store and had been sent to Bangalore office. Amazon is selling all defective products in the sale at lower price so that they can fool customer with the cheaper price. Amazon has started fooling customer with the hidden policies.
Got it on 8 th Aug did not open it due to corona . Had to travel to hp so put it into use 4 days back There is a problem with sound very low sound have to put it on speaker to hear the conversation . How can a new brand phone have this problem kindly look into it . Also in this corona time the return/replace window should be a little more relaxed as we senior citizens will not take this risk of using it immediately . Kindly look into the matter asap
MRP on product is 69k for 128gb variant but Amazon is selling for 73.6k saying revised price after April’2020. Is this justified? Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviour Now come to the phone- Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible . I am using it as dual sim and not sure if it bcoz of this. Battery also taking too much time to get charged Mobile is heating after half an hour of use
"This phone is bit big to hold but good for Android users. As per the design review, the phone is excellent with great camera both normal and wide angle, a good sound quality and the replicate feature was awesome to to copy data from old iPhone to your new iPhone."
"This is my 5th iPhone, iPhone 3G, 3Gs, 4S, 6 and now 11. Have used iPhone 6 more than 3.8 years. It is true when you keen to precision then nothing else can compete with the iPhone. Love the Portrait modes, wide-angle and the screen size. iPhone ring, a new tone is available now. Jio took only 30 minutes to activate the Esim."
Happy Fillings
Its my first iphone and now I’m feeling like I’ve wasted my money coz it has heating issues
Not good when I charge mobilebody was earth (current shock) and today charger not working I don’t no how to replace
"Bought iPhone from seller Appario Retail. Phone had multiple issues such as WiFi, mobile network (no network for 10 days), facelock was working on multiple people etc in just 3 months of use. I have given my phone to apple service center and its been 10 days and its not fixed. STAY very careful before buying from this seller. Read mutilple bad reviews and I think seller is selling defective phones."
"PROS : 1. Excellent phone with sleek screen 2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day 3. Face recognition is smooth CONS: 1. Just the exchange process is very very complex If you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps 1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange 2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away 3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number. 4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same. 5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone. 6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email. 7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device. 8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away. 9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT. 10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service. I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone. SUMMARY: GREAT PHONE, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CALL CENTER FOLKS, GREAT EXCHANGE PRICE BUT EXTREMELY TOUGH EXCHANGE PROCESS."
"The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome. Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging. The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant). Cons: 1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears. 2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger. Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro). But the product is great and I'm just lovin it."
"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!"
The Apple iPhone 11 that I received today had already been opened. I got it without any deal or plastic cover. I don’t know if it’s damaged inside I am not touching it Please take it back and give me a completely new packed one. I am extremely upset about this.
"hello Please dont take any apple products online , especially if the seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd. I bought iphone 11 last month and suudenly today (17/08/2020) the phone got switched off and not getting switched on again.It was neither damaged nor it got wet in rains . I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust. My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller. This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces. My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller."
"In my opinion, don’t think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the difference Pros- 1. Best Camera 2. Best Security 3. Long day Battery Life 4. Touch ID improved 5. Its an iPhone after all . ?? 6. Best Night-mode support 7. Best Processors A13 Bionic Chip Cons- 1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn’t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome. 2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 8 3. Thick bezels Guys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal. And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you. Got for it Guys !!!"
The only apple product i can buy with the money left in my account is Apple juice.
"If its just looks what you want then go ahead and buy...but its performance..then suggest you guys to back off. I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi]. After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up. Show some sense of urgency towards customer issues. Ok...folks its upto you to buy or not, just sharing my own experience so it will help who are thinking to buy this."
"1.Very fast No comparison with 8,12,12Gh rams. 2. Camera great beyond MPs 48mp is nothing . Iphone camera is fast far batter.3. No comparison Androids 11.4 Light weight5ThankUApple. TODAY 19 July 2020 MY PHONE FALLEN FROM 1st floor ON HARD SURFACE. After CHECKING-0 SCRATCHIEST.——great great"
"I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good. Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!! The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed. Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how). So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints."
Pros: Camera quality is 09/10. Display 09/10 Battery life 10/10 Heating issue : I face no heating issue Product genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original. Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt. Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.
"Phenomenal is the word , apple finally clicks in India with its predatory pricing and top notch feature which makes it hard to let go. The battery is running strong and the added extra camera is a plus. Apple you aced this one."
"Received Defective, Screen Bleeding Issue"
"If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions. I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing. You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future."
"Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed. Edit - I returned this phone and got refund from amazon and bought the same from flipkart ..and it got no issues ."
"Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details."
Battery life is good. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage. Performs well in day to day task. Mine is a made in india model which feels nice. Weight of the phone is a little downside. It feels heavy at 192gms
"Not rating right now. But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario. The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty. One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time. I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year.. He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair. So here i am writing this. First two days review Battery life ok Camera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg) Face id good Interface once u get everything its hard to not track everything Rest everything is typical apple Con Phone is heavy hahaha Ill try to keep updating.. Update: phone is working good the way i use it my phone is still at 100% capacity.. daily avg use is 2:30hrs to 4:15hrs I have not installed any google apps at all. And no streaming apps Only work and paytm and banking apps With social media apps excluding facebook Update #2 it is almost a year now and my bettery health is still at 100%. i charge at 30% and till 82-86% no fb snapchat or any google app. PEACE."
This I phone11 model {black} looks like Chinese phone.I suggest don't purchase and go with Iphone's other model.
I have received this product with defective speakers. Amazon is saying to visit Apple website. I have no clue what to do in this regard? At first place you send us a defective product and instead of initiating a replacement you ask us to visit Apply store. Is this even fair?
"The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it . The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it . But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone . Even from a small distance you can get small visual small cracks"
"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."
"Do not purchase iPhone from Amazon I purchased this device, and camera quality is worst I compared with the other iPhone 11 device and this device camera is totally useless. And phone not charging after 3hr of charging it charged 25%. I tried contacting with Amazon for replacement and they told me to go to apple and apple telling me to check with Amazon. It's it amazing. #donotbuyapple products from Amazon"
